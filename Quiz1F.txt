Why does the raspberry pi functioning?

	The raspberry pi is functioning because the charger used meets the requirement that able the rpi to on, indications are when red light is steadily on
 and the green light is blinking. Another reason is there is an operating system installed. The connecting wires used are in good condition.

	This answer is according to Mr. Salon because he did the troubleshooting on his raspberry pi, the site he searched was elinux.org/R-Pi-troubleshooting.
I also based my answer, on what Mr. Cotacte said because they've tried troubleshooting the raspberry pi.
