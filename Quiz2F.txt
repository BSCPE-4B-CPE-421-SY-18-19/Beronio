OBSERVATION
	When we troubleshoot the system unit, the reason why it is not functioning is because the powersupply is defective. Eventhough the CPU fan is functional, we fail
to check the motherboard because the powersupply has a problem. We also observe that the parts of the system is not clean, it has lots of dusts and other components are 
so old which we think an additional reason why it is not functioning.

	We think that we need to change the fuse of the powersupply, if it is still not functioning change the system unit's powersupply. When you already change the 
powersupply and the problem is still there buy a new system unit.

Note: Make sure that all the components and other parts of the system unit are clean.
